# Node.js Starter Template with TypeScript (Strict Mode)

This is a basic Node.js starter template with TypeScript configured in strict mode. It provides you with a minimal project structure and configuration to kickstart your Node.js application development using TypeScript.

## Features

- Ready-to-use Node.js project with TypeScript support.
- Basic folder structure for organizing your code.
- Example TypeScript file to get you started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Node.js installed on your local machine.
- npm (Node Package Manager) installed.

## Getting Started

To get started with this template, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rojta/node-ts-starter
```

2. Change into the project directory:

```bash
cd node-ts-starter
```

3. Install the project dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will compile the TypeScript code and start the Node application.

## Project Structure

The project structure is organized as follows:

- `src/`: This folder contains your TypeScript source code.
- `dist/`: This folder is automatically generated and contains the compiled JavaScript code.
- `package.json`: Configuration file for Node.js project dependencies.
- `tsconfig.json`: TypeScript compiler configuration with strict mode enabled.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Usage

You can start building your Node.js application by adding your own code to the src/ folder. TypeScript files in this folder will be compiled to JavaScript in the dist/ folder.
